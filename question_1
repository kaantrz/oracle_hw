SQL is for relational databases and NoSQL is for non-relational databases. NoSQL databases scale better horizontally, while SQL primarily scales vertically meaning you can increase the load on a server by migrating to a larger server that adds more CPU, RAM or SSD capacity. SQL database schema uses tables with columns or attributes and rows of records, while NoSQL uses four different types of of structures; column-oriented, key-value stores, document stores, and graph databases.
